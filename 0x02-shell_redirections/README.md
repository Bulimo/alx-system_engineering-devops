In this lesson we learn about command line feature I/O redirections.
The I/O stands for input/output, and with this facility you can redirect
the input and output of commands to and from files, as well as 
connect multiple commands to make powerful command pipelines.
 We worked wit sort, grep, cut, find, tr among other commands.
